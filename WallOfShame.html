<h2>FileZilla, SourceForge and Yahoo</h2>

<p> On January 11, 2015, I updated my version of FileZilla to 3.10.0.2. The default version of the protocol to transfer files  
		changed from FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to TLS (Transport Layer Security). Unfortunately, I wasn't warnered about this in bold,
		and my website host did not support TLS. The error FileZilla gave me was that my host's certificate was bad. 
		So I went to FileZilla's website, and downloaded a new version of FileZilla. This version used SourceForge to install FileZilla. 
		When SourceForge wanted to install additional software, I did not agree to their term. It didn't matter;
		it didn't opt me out. It installed software that  hijacked all my browsers and made the default search Yahoo. 

		Yeah, I tried to opt out, and so did others. See the link below:

        <P> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/reviews"> SourceForge Filezilla Reviews </a></p>

        <P> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/reviews/?offset=50"> SourceForge Filezilla Offset 50</a></p>

        <P> <a href="https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=31967">Forms Filezilla Project</a></p>

	<p> Besides, why should anyone have to put up with being tricked into downloading software that they didn't want. </p>
	
	<p> FileZilla got money from SourceForge, and they got money from Yahoo. It took me hours, to get control of my computer back. 
		My solution: I don't use Yahoo for search, email or anything else. If I see someone else using Yahoo, I try to persuade them 
		not to use it. Ditto for SourceForge and FileZilla. They hijacked my computer; they are unethical. If they had been upfront and
		informed me that to download and use FileZilla, I had to use Yahoo search, I would not have downloaded the program. 
		Furthermore, they know that and they resorted to trickery and then they didn't let you opt out. Well, I hope, they all go under. </p>

<h2>Avery Labels</h2>

<p>In May 2015, I needed to download a template for Avery address labels. Although, there were two option to download the template, I could only select the default option that included the "Avery Toolbar". </p>

<a href="http://www.avery.com/avery/en_us/Templates-%26-Software/Templates/Labels/Address-Labels/Address-Label-20-per-sheet-_-1x4_Microsoft-Word.htm?N=4294963712%204294965751&refchannel=ff06379e6fa72210VgnVCM1000002118140aRCRD">  Avery Template Download Page </a>

<p> Why do they want to track their customers everywhere they go on the Internet, or do they want to send them ads? The price for downloading the template was too high. I am no longer one of the on

<h2>Canon EOS Software</h2>

<p>Canon's EOS Utility is used to download photographs from the camera to a PC or Mac. On May 11, 2015  my old version would not work on Apple's OS X Yosemite. I downloaded a new version. Will first it downloaded an installer, and then the installer forced me to download two other programs to get the EOS Utility. The other two programs were: the Lens Registration Tool and Web Services Registration. I did not want either of the extra programs. I was going to spend $1,500 on a new Canon camera this month - the Canon T6s. Now, I am going to purchase a Nikon.

<h2>Apple Computers</h2>

<p>On June 13, 2015, I tied up my Macbook Pro and my iPhone for 8 hours downloading a new version of iOS only to receive an unknown error after 8 plus hours. When I attempted to download the software again, it informed me the download would take 7 hours. "Enough" is "enough", I am not tying up my computer and iPhone for 8 hours at a time trying to update the OS. Apple is obviously selling more iPhone than they have bandwidth.

<h2>United Airlines</h2>

<p>On June 16, 2015, I waited at Louisville, KY Airport (SDF) Gate A11 for over two hours until my flight should have started boarding. There was no one working at Gate A11. The kiosk at Gate A11 said the flights to Albuquerque and Denver were canceled, but it never said anything about my flight to Chicago being delayed. I would miss my connection to Jackson, MS.  United could not get me home that evening, and I had to pay for my hotel room. I was not the only one that went to the next gate and complained to United that there was no one working at Gate A11 and the kiosk did not say anything about the flight to Chicago being delayed. I will remember this the next time I have a choice of airlines. You too, have a choice of airlines...
</P>
What should have United Airlines done? Here is a technology writer's opinion: <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-ignore-data-and-anger-your-customers/"> zdnet: "How to ignore data and anger your customers (a recent travel nightmare)". </a> So I am not the only one that thinks they screwed up.

<h2>HostGator Review</h2> 

<p>On November 20, 2015, I made a request to have one of my websites migrated from GoDaddy to HostGator - Transfer Request ID:178021. On November 24, I replied to Job Ticket (No.: GJJ-40167334 ), and asked them if they had forgot about me.  On December 12, I reminded them again by replying to the Job Ticket that I was still waiting for my website to be migrated. On December 14, I received a reply that they were migrating the website. <b> It took two reminders and  23 days before they even begin the migration process. </b>.  There were problems with the migration, and after calling their technical support three times, the problems still were not resolved. You can expect long waits for technical support, and they are incompetent. 40 days after I begin the migration process, I came to the conclusion that I was never going to get my website up and running. Buyer beware!

<h2> Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500</h2> 

<p>In 2015, I purchased a Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500 page scanner. The first time I tried to update the software, they didn't give me the option of opting out from installing both DropBox and Evernote! Buyer beware!

<h2>AT&T Internet Service and Email</h2> 

<p>On July 29, 2016, I tried to help my cousin set up her email client program, Microsof Live Mail, so she could send emails. She wasn't having a problem recieving emails. I traced this problem to October 2015 when AT&T retired their old email servers and required everyone to change the names  on thier clients. As AT&T requested, I changed the server names to "inbound.att.net" and outbound.att.net. This fixed her problem with sending emails, but her client program kept trying to re-read the emails that were already in her inbox. </p>
<p>
I knew better, but my cousin called AT&T technical support. Needless to say, " English" was not the girls first language. She wasted my time "insisting" that I log into AT&T's  web email, and see if I could read email there. Then she told me that this was all she could do, and she was going to transfer me to AT&T Connecteck, and there would be a fee. If AT&T is going to provide email with their Internet Service, then they should support it. 
</p>
<p> This must be an old copy becasuse I do not see GitHub o  it </p>
